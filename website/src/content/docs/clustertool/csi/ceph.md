:::caution[Work In Progress]

This program, all its features and its general design, are all a Work-In-Progress. It is not done and not widely available.

All code and docs are considered Pre-Beta drafts

Rook-CEPH is a kubernetes operator to deploy a ceph cluster from within kubernetes.
Its a lot more complex and offers a LOT more features compared to most other CSIs and any issues would likely require significant time investment, for it being a actual enterprise-grade storage solution.
